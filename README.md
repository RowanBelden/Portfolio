## Projects

### Data Analysis and Visualization with R
- **Project Name**: Customer Churn Analysis using R Studio
- **Description**: The goal of the analysis is to determine which variables are best at predicting whether a customer will “churn”. Churn means the customer stopped using the company’s product or service. The dataset is for a telecommunications company called Telco so in the context of the data churn means that the customer terminated their subscription. With this analysis, Telco will have a better idea of what factors contribute to their clients leaving and therefore develop a plan to retain them.

### Data Analysis, Simulation, and Risk Analysis with Excel
- **Project Name**: Fabric Manufacturing Simulation & Risk Analysis
- **Description**: The goal of the analysis is to run a time & cost simulation of the fabric manufacturing process to determine the best, worst, and average scenarios for business preparation purposes. The analysis also involved a risk analysis to determine the number of worst-case scenarios and the probability that an occurrence will be worst-case.

### Database Creation & Population using SQL
- **Project Name**: Creating Inkwell Database
- **Description**: This project involves the creation of tables to store various types of data such as genres, authors, publishers, libraries, employees, books, customers, loans, and reservations. The code also includes bulk insertion commands to populate these tables with data from CSV files. Additionally, the code creates views to simplify the querying of complex relationships between tables, user-defined functions for common data manipulation tasks, and stored procedures to provide insights into customer loans and library reservations.

### Internship
<img src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1736285/DesireCo_Logo_Black_Logo.jpg?p=facebook" width="500">

During the summer of 2023, I interned at The Desire Company, a media firm in downtown Chicago. My primary focus was on conducting comprehensive data analysis using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to extract insights for strategic decisions and website optimization. This involved delving into website traffic, user behavior, and engagement metrics to identify patterns and outliers that guided marketing strategies and improved user experience.

Additionally, I played a pivotal role in refining the B2B website, collaborating with the web development team to enhance user engagement and increase conversion rates. Through A/B testing, user feedback analysis, and continuous iteration, we successfully implemented changes that led to measurable improvements in website performance. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply classroom knowledge to real-world scenarios, making a tangible impact on the company's digital presence and processes.
